 Absolute paths always start out with the root directory /. Then we specify the sub-directories we want to descend into, /home/bob/Documents/Invoice.pdf is an example of such a path. In this case, first home, then bob, then Documents. We can see the sub-directory names are separated by a / and we finally get to the file we want to access i.e Invoice.pdf. An absolute path can end with the name of a file or a directory. As per the example given above If we'd want to delete the Documents directory, how would we specify the path? the answer is /home/bob/Documents
